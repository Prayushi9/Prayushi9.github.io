# Research
Currently, I am involved in a research project of Multiple Organ Segmentation and NLP using Deep Learning.

#### 3D Glioma Brain Tumor Segmentation of MR Images 
- Segmentation of glioma tumor from MRI considering 3D volume.
- Our model trained on BraTS 2018-19 dataset.

#### Denoising Autoencoder using GAN
- Combined the two prominent models of deep learning i.e. Autoencoder and GAN.
- Denoising the MNIST dataset and 2-D Brain image dataset.
- Our model used Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder and reached to a good PSNR value.

#### Object Identification
- Implemented YOLO v2/v3 on custom objects which converts high resolution images to low resolution images and try to detect the objects.
- Worked on Retinanet (RESNET50) which maintains the quality of image. 

#### Type-2 Diabetes
- Worked in Data Mining and Machine Learning on real data of around 12k patients containing 373+ attributes.
- It included the triopathy of diabetes i.e. Nephropathy, Neuropathy and Retinopathy. 
- The model act as an assistant of the doctor which helps in diagnosis of Nephropathy mainly.

# Other Projects

#### Music Creator
- Built an Android application for creating and playing musical instruments like piano, drum, etc.
- It also allowed recording various tunes for playback later using Android Studio 2.3.3.
